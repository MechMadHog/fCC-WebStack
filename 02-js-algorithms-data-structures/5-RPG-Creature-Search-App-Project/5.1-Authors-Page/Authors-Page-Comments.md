## 4.3 🧑‍💻 Authors Page  
**Origin:** FCC Authors Page (JSON Fetch + DOM Update)

**What I learned:**  
- First project working with **external JSON data** fetched using `fetch()` and `.then()` promises  
- Introduced to **`<=` (less than or equal to)** comparison, which controls the “no more data” logic  
- Learned how to **slice arrays dynamically** with `.slice(startingIndex, endingIndex)` for pagination  
- Reinforced **event-driven UI updates** — button click triggers more authors to load  
- Practiced **error handling** with `.catch()` to gracefully show user feedback  
- Combined multiple DOM manipulation techniques (`innerHTML +=`, `textContent`, `style.cursor`, `disabled`)  
- Improved understanding of **template literals** for dynamic HTML generation  
- Used a **ternary operator** for inline logic (`bio.length > 50 ? bio.slice(0, 50) + "..." : bio`)  
- Added small UI touches like a “purple-divider” and “No more data to load” state for a complete experience

### 🧩 Syntax Note: `=>` vs `<=`
When I first saw these two symbols together in the same file, I didn’t realize they meant completely different things.

- **`=>`** Arrow Function syntax  
  Defines a function.  
  ```js
  const fetchMoreAuthors = () => { /* code */ }
  ```
  Think of it as: “*input goes to output*”.

- **`<=`** Comparison Operator  
  Tests whether the left value is less than or equal to the right.  
  ```js
  if (authorDataArr.length <= endingIndex) { /* stop loading */ }
  ```
  Think of it as: “*is the left side smaller or equal to the right side?*”

**Mnemonic:**  
🟢 `=>` points *into* a function body.  
🔵 `<=` points *toward* a number or value for comparison.

**Reflection:**  
This was the first project where the logic felt close to how real applications load data like managing indexes, preventing overflow, and responding to user interaction.  
Also, this was when I first understood how arrow functions (`=>`) and comparison operators (`<=`) can appear together but serve totally different purposes.
