# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures ‚Äî Portfolio Projects

**FreeCodeCamp Certificate 02: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (In Progress)**  
[View Certificate](#)  

üß© This is my second FreeCodeCamp certificate.  
Here the focus shifts from *design and layout* to **pure programming**: solving problems, building algorithms, and implementing data structures with JavaScript.  

Many of these projects will start small and practical ‚Äî validators, converters, and calculators ‚Äî but the goal, as with my first certificate, is to **expand and customize** each one into something that feels like a true portfolio piece.  

## üìö Sub-Projects
Alongside the main certificate projects, I‚Äôll be creating smaller apps and experiments with JavaScript:

## 1. üîÅ Palindrome Checker
**Origin:** FCC Palindrome Checker  
**Project:** [CodePen](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/qEbZBaR)  
**What I learned:**
- Translate user stories into exact elements and behaviors: `#text-input`, `#check-btn`, `#result`, alert on empty input
- Clean input with a simple regex to ignore punctuation, spaces, case... reuse skills from Calorie Counter
- Compare normalized text by reversing a string with basic array methods
- Keep output wording exact so tests pass... `${original} is a palindrome.` or `${original} is not a palindrome.`
- Wire events the simple way: `addEventListener('click')` and handle `submit` for keyboard users
- Accessibility first: labeled inputs, `aria-live` result, high contrast focus styles
- Light ‚ÄúAlice in Wonderland‚Äù theme while keeping readability and contrast strong

- **1.2 Gradebook App ‚Üí** *Handwritten Copybook Gradebook*  
  [Gradebook App](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/wBKZGym)  
  *Learned: parsing text input into scores, mapping results through conditional grading logic, and wiring it into the DOM with HTML/CSS. Styled to look like a school copybook to match the gradebook theme.*

- **1.3 Role-Playing Game ‚Üí** *Echoes Beyond the Rift*  
  [RPG](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/jEbgZmy)  
  *Learned: reskinning a JS game without adding complexity, managing state for themed stats, swapping locations through a locations array, 4-button grid UI, random event hooks for the Easter egg, and a simple modal for story and instructions.*
 
- **1.4 Random Background Color Changer ‚Üí** *Lightbulb Switch*  
  [Lightbulb](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/XJXrMGp)  
  *Learned: debugging basic JS errors (array commas, Math case, querySelector syntax), connecting a button to trigger style changes, practicing switch logic by toggling classes, and applying the idea to an SVG lightbulb for a visual on/off effect.*  

- **1.5 Calorie Counter ‚Üí** *Health App Tracker*  
  [Calorie Counter](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/RNrwKgP)  
  *Learned: regex input cleaning; NodeList loops with `item.value`; live meal totals and hydration; exercise add back; 24 hour fast toggle; auto TDEE targets.*

- **1.6 Rock Paper Scissors Game ‚Üí** *Best of 5 Click Duel*  
  [Rock Paper Scissors](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/bNENBBZ)  
  *Learned: simple JS loop (click ‚Üí compute ‚Üí update); small helper functions (`getRandomComputerResult`, `hasPlayerWonTheRound`); DOM updates with `innerText`; score state with first to 3 win check; end message and reset button.*

- **1.7 Music Player** ‚Üí *JJ & Derek Mixtape Player*  
  [Music Player](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/dPGGjRZ)  
  *Learned: adapting FCC starter into my own style; swapping demo tracks for 5 originals from my jsDelivr CDN; fixing display update bug; preloading durations from metadata; styling with CRT-inspired neon theme and custom album art from Westmeath.*

## 2. üî¢ Roman Numeral Converter  
**Origin:** FCC Roman Numeral Converter  
**Project:** [CodePen](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/ZYQeZBm)  
**What I learned:**  
- Followed all FCC user stories exactly ‚Äî handling invalid, low, and high numbers with clear messages  
- Built a clean conversion loop using a value/symbol map instead of nested conditionals  
- Reused validation and DOM logic from previous projects (Palindrome Checker, Binary Converter)  
- Learned how small helper functions keep logic readable and test-safe  
- Re-skinned my Greek ‚ÄúPhiloDuel‚Äù theme into a Roman variant ‚Äî bronze, marble, deep red, and Cinzel type for an imperial look  


- **2.1 Date Formatter** ‚Üí *Retro Date Utility*  
  [Date Formatter](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/RNraPar)  
  *Learned: FCC JS 2nd section project; rebuilt into a CRT-themed utility with boot-up typewriter effect, green phosphor glow, scanlines, and flicker; added extra formats (ISO 8601, UNIX timestamp, weekday, locale long); made live formats auto-update like a terminal command.*  

- **2.2 Football Team Cards** ‚Üí *HABS Roster Cards*  
  [Montreal Canadiens Cards](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/RNrRjvQ)  
  *Learned: took the FCC Football Team Cards project and re-skinned it for the Montreal Canadiens‚Ä¶ swapped football positions for hockey roles‚Ä¶ added a top-centered Habs logo‚Ä¶ pulled player headshots from my jsDelivr CDN with a fallback image and versioned cache-busting‚Ä¶ added a captain badge, nickname filter, and position filters‚Ä¶ styled everything in Habs red/blue/white to match the brand.*  

- **2.3 To-Do App** ‚Üí *Mixtape Playlist Maker*  
  [Playlist Maker](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/pvgNprM)  
  *Learned: took FCC‚Äôs basic To-Do app logic (add, edit, delete, localStorage) and flipped it into something I‚Äôd actually use ‚Äî a playlist builder; swapped ‚Äútasks‚Äù for tracks (title, artist, notes/links); styled it like a Spotify clone but in my brand (purple + dark grey); added search bar to filter tracks; future plans include album art, audio previews from jsDelivr CDN, and drag-and-drop reordering.*  

- **2.4 Decimal to Binary Converter** ‚Üí *Futuristic Number Translator*  
  [Decimal ‚Üí Binary Converter](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/LEGWaPr)  
  *Learned: rebuilt FCC‚Äôs recursive converter into a clean, robotic-themed UI with neon cyan accents; added full input sanitization so you can‚Äôt enter minus numbers, decimals, or scientific notation ‚Äî only whole numbers 0 and up; added a call-stack animation when input is 5 to show how recursion unwinds; refined layout into a flat futuristic card design for clarity and style.*
