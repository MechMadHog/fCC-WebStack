# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures — Portfolio Projects

**FreeCodeCamp Certificate 02: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (In Progress)**  
[View Certificate](#)  

🧩 This is my second FreeCodeCamp certificate.  
Here the focus shifts from *design and layout* to **pure programming**: solving problems, building algorithms, and implementing data structures with JavaScript.  

Many of these projects will start small and practical — validators, converters, and calculators — but the goal, as with my first certificate, is to **expand and customize** each one into something that feels like a true portfolio piece.

## 📚 Sub-Projects
Alongside the main certificate projects, I’ll be creating smaller apps and experiments with JavaScript:  

- **1.1 Pyramid Generator →** *Retro CRT Pyramid Console*  
  [Pyramid Generator](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/qEOvBap)  
  *Learned: JS basics (loops, strings), DOM buttons to run code, `<pre>` to preserve spacing, height slider & character input, plus an inverted toggle—all wrapped in an 80s/90s CRT theme.*
  
- **1.2 Gradebook App →** *Handwritten Copybook Gradebook*  
  [Gradebook App](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/wBKZGym)  
  *Learned: parsing text input into scores, mapping results through conditional grading logic, and wiring it into the DOM with HTML/CSS. Styled to look like a school copybook to match the gradebook theme.*

- **1.3 Role-Playing Game →** *Echoes Beyond the Rift*  
  [RPG](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/jEbgZmy)  
  *Learned: reskinning a JS game without adding complexity, managing state for themed stats, swapping locations through a locations array, 4-button grid UI, random event hooks for the Easter egg, and a simple modal for story and instructions.*
 
- **1.4 Random Background Color Changer →** *Lightbulb Switch*  
  [Lightbulb](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/XJXrMGp)  
  *Learned: debugging basic JS errors (array commas, Math case, querySelector syntax), connecting a button to trigger style changes, practicing switch logic by toggling classes, and applying the idea to an SVG lightbulb for a visual on/off effect.*  

- **1.5 Calorie Counter →** *Health App Tracker*  
  [Calorie Counter](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/RNrwKgP)  
  *Learned: regex input cleaning; NodeList loops with `item.value`; live meal totals and hydration; exercise add back; 24 hour fast toggle; auto TDEE targets.*

- **1.6 Rock Paper Scissors Game** → [Link TBD]  
- **1.7 Music Player** → [Link TBD]  

- **2.1 Date Formatter** → [Link TBD]  
- **2.2 Football Team Cards** → [Link TBD]  
- **2.3 Todo App** → [Link TBD]  
- **2.4 Decimal to Binary Converter** → [Link TBD]  

- **3.1 Spam Filter** → [Link TBD]  
- **3.2 Number Sorter** → [Link TBD]  
- **3.3 Statistics Calculator** → [Link TBD]  
- **3.4 Spreadsheet** → [Link TBD]  

- **4.1 Shopping Cart** → [Link TBD]  
- **4.2 Platformer Game** → [Link TBD]  
- **4.3 Dice Game** → [Link TBD]  

- **5.1 Authors Page** → [Link TBD]  
- **5.2 Forum Leaderboard** → [Link TBD]

## 🎓 Conclusion
This section will eventually summarize the **core skills** I developed across the 5 major projects and 20+ sub-projects:  
- Algorithm design and problem-solving  
- Working with arrays, objects, and strings  
- Regular expressions  
- DOM manipulation with JavaScript  
- Building interactive applications

## 🚀 Next Step
After this, I’ll move on to **Front End Development Libraries** — integrating JavaScript with frameworks and UI libraries to create full interactive web apps.
