# üé• JavaScript SideTrack Companion (Visual Learning Playlist)

Programming is definitely a jump up from HTML/CSS... this playlist mixes **Kurzgesagt-style overviews** with **hands-on coding videos** to make the concepts stick.

I want to reach a point where **coding feels the same as playing with K‚Äônex**. When I was younger, I could throw all of the pieces on the floor... **see what I wanted to build in my head... and just start piecing it together** into whatever I imagined... no instructions needed. **Programming is obviously more complex than HTML and CSS... but my goal is to have that same level of fluency**: to see **functions, arrays, and objects as pieces I can click together** in different ways until something useful takes shape. Like K‚Äônex... it will take a many hours of **building, breaking, and rebuilding** before the pieces feel natural in my hands... but once they do I will be able to **create freely**.

### üìå How to Use This Playlist
1. Watch the **Kurzgesagt-style / conceptual video** first ‚Üí build intuition.  
2. Then watch the **practical tutorial** ‚Üí reinforce by coding along.  
3. Immediately apply what you learned in FCC challenges or your RPG project.  
4. Loop back when concepts don‚Äôt ‚Äústick‚Äù yet. Repetition is key.
