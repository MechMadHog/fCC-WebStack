## 🔮 SnapLogic Continued – Beyond K’nex

Some concepts don’t fit neatly into rods, connectors, or gears. For those, we extend the metaphor with other tools, toys, and everyday objects. The goal is the same: keep everything physical and intuitive so the concepts stick.

### 🔢 Operators ( + − × ÷ == && || )
- **Analogy:** Calculator buttons.  
- Operators transform or compare values like pressing buttons to manipulate numbers.  
- Example: `2 + 2` → pressing the “+” button with two rods on each side.  

---

### ✂️ String Methods
- **Analogy:** Scissors, tape, and labels.  
- Strings are like strips of paper with words. Methods let you cut them, tape them together, or relabel them.  
- `.split()` → cut into p i e c e s .  
- `.toUpperCase()` → write in BIG BOLD LETTERS.  

---

### 🛡️ Error Handling (`try/catch`)
- **Analogy:** Crash mats or circuit breakers.  
- They don’t stop mistakes, but they **catch the fall** so the whole program doesn’t break.  

---

### 🧰 ES6 Features
- **Spread Operator (`...`)** → A scoop or shovel that dumps multiple pieces into a build at once.  
- **Template Literals (`` `Hello ${name}` ``)** → A stencil for stamping dynamic labels.  
- **Destructuring** → A sorting tray, automatically pulling the exact pieces you need out of a bin.  

---

### 🪆 Recursion
- **Analogy:** Russian nesting dolls.  
- A function that calls itself is like opening one doll to find another inside... until you hit the smallest one.

### 🗂️ Data Structures Beyond Arrays & Objects
- **Stack** → A pile of plates. Last plate on → first plate off (LIFO).  
- **Queue** → A line of people. First in line → first served (FIFO).  
- **Set** → A bin that refuses duplicates. Drop in two identical rods, only one stays.  
- **Map** → A labeled toolbox drawer. Each label (key) points to a specific item (value).

### 🔑 Conclusion:
Using all of the K’nex pieces to create a mind map gives me a foundation. Then on top of that, I can expand my analogies with other familiar concepts to cover the rest. Every new coding concept has a physical counterpart... I just need to find the right metaphor and snap it into a complete mental model.
