# Responsive Web Design ‚Äî Portfolio Projects

**FreeCodeCamp Certificate 01: Responsive Web Design (Completed)**  
[View Certificate](#)  

‚úÖ 20 personal projects completed 
Fifteen of the projects in this repo were built directly alongside the FCC lessons, although what I have added to my Codepen are **completely unique expansions** I created to avoid just repeating the standard course work.  

Every single one of these projects were carefully **thought up, restyled, and iterated** by me until I was satisfied with the final result.  

And are they truly finished? Maybe not. For example, it would be amazing to eventually turn the **Star Wars Holo-Chess** board into a fully playable game. These projects are stepping stones as much as they are portfolio pieces.
