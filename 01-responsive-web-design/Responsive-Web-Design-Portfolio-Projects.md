# Responsive Web Design Projects Overview

This Markdown file tracks all my progress through the FreeCodeCamp **Responsive Web Design** Certification.  
I’ve taken each core project and expanded it with my own creative sub-projects, turning the basic lessons into unique portfolio pieces. All of them are published in the following CodePen collection:

## 🚀 What This Becomes

Once the course is finished, I’ll not only earn the **Responsive Web Design certificate**—I’ll also have a full CodePen portfolio of original, stylized versions of every major project and sub-project.

This collection is a demonstration of how I:
- Apply what I’ve learned
- Build creatively from simple structures
- Transform tutorials into something personal and impressive

## 📦 Future Plans

- Additional collections may follow (e.g., **Frontend Libraries**, **JavaScript Algorithms**), but I expect this one certificate + portfolio will be enough to stand out to any employer.
