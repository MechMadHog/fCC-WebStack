# Rodney Mullen Tribute Page ðŸ›¹

A reimagined version of the [freeCodeCamp Tribute Page project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), dedicated to **Rodney Mullen** â€” the godfather of street skateboarding. This project satisfies all the original HTML and CSS user stories while showcasing modern, clean design practices.

---

## ðŸ§ª Features

- **Semantic HTML5** structure with `id` elements matching FCC tests
- Fully **responsive layout** using CSS Grid and Flexbox principles
- Subtle **hover animations** on timeline dates and images
- Center-aligned **header and footer** for a clean, balanced look
- Color palette inspired by the original CSS but modernized with `:root` variables
- Image assets sourced from original HTML for authenticity
- No JavaScript â€” **pure HTML & CSS**

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Notes

- The header and footer use a **soft cyan background** (`#e0f7fa`) with center-aligned text, matching the original aesthetic.
- **Timeline items** have a left accent border that changes color on hover, along with a slight upward lift for interactivity.
- All images are responsive (`max-width: 100%`, `height: auto`) and have a subtle shadow and border radius.
- Fonts:
  - **Headings**: `Montserrat`, bold and clear
  - **Body text**: `Lato`, comfortable for long reads
- The layout adapts gracefully to smaller screens using `auto-fit` and `minmax` in CSS Grid.
