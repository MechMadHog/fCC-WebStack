# Rothko-Painting-Comments

## What I Learned from This Project

### 🖼️ Simplicity Can Be Powerful
- I discovered how minimal HTML structure—just a few `div` elements—can be used creatively to mimic complex artistic ideas like a Rothko painting.
- This project reminded me that in both art and code, less is often more.

### 🎨 CSS as a Brush
- I learned how to “paint” with CSS using `background-color`, `border-radius`, and `box-shadow`.
- Each colored `div` layered with blur and rotation gave the illusion of abstract brushstrokes.
- Color combinations were chosen deliberately to simulate Rothko’s palette: warm, emotional tones with slight imperfections.

### 🌀 Embracing Imperfection
- Using `transform: rotate()` added organic, hand-made flaws to the shapes—something I wouldn't have thought to use in the past for aesthetic effect.
- The combination of blur and slight rotation made the boxes feel “painted” instead of rendered.

### 🖌️ Blurring for Texture
- I used different levels of the `filter: blur()` property to soften the visual edges and create a dream-like, smeared-paint texture.
- I hadn’t fully appreciated how blur could simulate texture without using any images.

### 🧱 Structural Framing
- The `.frame` class introduced a clean, gallery-like presentation that contrasts nicely with the messy abstract canvas inside.
- It helped me understand how layout and framing can shift the viewer’s perception of what’s inside—just like in a museum.

### 📐 Measurement and Positioning
- I practiced percentage vs. pixel-based widths and saw how `margin: auto` can center elements without flexbox or grid.
- I experimented with size contrast between the rectangles, making some deliberately off-balance for artistic effect.
