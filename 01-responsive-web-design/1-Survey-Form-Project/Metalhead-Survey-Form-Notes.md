# Metalhead Survey Form 🤘

A creative remix of the [freeCodeCamp Survey Form project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and my **first main project** in the Responsive Web Design Certification path.

This version transforms the basic form requirements into a sarcastic, opinionated, and fun quiz for metal fans. Users are asked to declare their favorite subgenres, choose a side in the “Big 4” debate, and check off the bands they actually rate — all while satisfying the original HTML and CSS user stories.
