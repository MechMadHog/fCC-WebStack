## 📐 Viewport Units

### `vh` – Viewport Height
- `vh` stands for **viewport height**
- `1vh` = 1% of the total height of the viewport (browser window)
- Useful for full-page layouts or vertically centering content

Example:
```css
min-height: 100vh;  /* Takes up the full height of the screen */
```

## ⌨️ Input Types in Forms

Specifying the `type` attribute for each `<input>` helps the browser validate and handle user input correctly.

### Common Input Types:
- `text` → Accepts plain text (default if no type is specified)
- `email` → Only allows input that includes `@` and a `.` (basic email format)
- `password` → Obscures the input characters; warns user if the site is not secure (non-HTTPS)

### Example:
```html
<input type="text">
<input type="email">
<input type="password">
```

In this form:
- The **first two inputs** use `type="text"`
- The **third** uses `type="email"`
- The **fourth** uses `type="password"`

## 📝 Input Types

Setting the `type` attribute on `<input>` elements tells the browser what kind of data to expect and how to validate it.

### Common Input Types Used:
- `text` – default input type; accepts any text
- `email` – expects a valid email format (must include `@` and domain like `.com`)
- `password` – obscures input for privacy and shows a warning if not using HTTPS

### Example:
```html
<input type="text">
<input type="email">
<input type="password">
```

Each type enhances form usability and improves browser-side validation.

## 🧾 Submit Button Behavior

- An `<input type="submit">` automatically submits its nearest `<form>` parent.
- The `value` attribute sets the button text.
- Placed after all form inputs (often outside the last `<fieldset>`).

### Example:
```html
<input type="submit" value="Submit">

---

## ✅ Required Fields

The `required` attribute makes an input field mandatory.  
If the user tries to submit the form without filling it in, the browser will show a built-in validation error.

- No value is needed: just include `required`
- Works with most input types like `text`, `email`, `password`, etc.

### Example:
```html
<input type="email" required>

---

## 🔒 Custom Input Validation

Some input types have built-in validation (e.g., `type="email"` checks for `@` and `.`).

You can add custom validation using attributes like `minlength`.

### `minlength`
- Sets the **minimum number of characters** required in an input
- Commonly used with passwords for basic security enforcement

### Example:
```html
<input type="password" minlength="8" required>
```

This ensures the user enters at least 8 characters before the form can be submitted.

---

## 🧩 Pattern Validation (Regex)

You can use the `pattern` attribute to apply **regular expression rules** to form inputs.

### Example:
```html
<input type="password" pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}" required>
