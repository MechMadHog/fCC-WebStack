# Personal Portfolio Webpage

FCC Responsive Web Design — **Main Project 5: Personal Portfolio Webpage**  
Theme: **Cyberpunk Purple Portfolio**

---

## What this is
This is the **final project** before earning my first FreeCodeCamp certificate.  
I went with a cyberpunk aesthetic again, this time built around **purple** — my favorite color.  

The page includes:
- `#welcome-section` with a full-viewport intro, logo, and about text.  
- `#navbar` sticky at the top, with my MMD logo and links.  
- `#projects` grid with `.project-tile` cards linking to my CodePen projects.  
- A footer with external links.  
- At least one **media query** for responsiveness.  

It was made using all of the new information and techniques I picked up during the Responsive Web Design course, especially CSS Grid and responsive layouts.
