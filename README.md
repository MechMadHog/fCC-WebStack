## 🎁 Bonuses & Practice Resources

### 🧠 Coding Interview Prep
A large bank of algorithms and data structure problems for brushing up before job interviews. Great for practicing logic and writing clean code under constraints.

### 🧮 Project Euler
A deep dive into math-heavy programming challenges that teach problem decomposition and efficient algorithms. Best for sharpening your logical thinking and numeric optimization skills.

### 🛠️ The Odin Project
Another full-stack curriculum that complements FCC with a more “build-first” approach. Especially good for learning Git, Node.js, and real-world workflows.

### 🌍 Rosetta Code
A repository of the same algorithm or task written in many programming languages. Perfect for language comparison, syntactic clarity, and seeing how problems are solved across paradigms.
