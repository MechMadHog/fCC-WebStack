# 🌐 My freeCodeCamp Web Development Path

Tracking my full progress through the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum — replacing social media with skill-building and working toward mastery in full-stack web development.

## 📅 Started: August 2025  
## 🔄 In Progress: Responsive Web Design  

---

## 🎯 Goal
Complete the **first seven Web-focused certifications**, build portfolio-ready projects, and document everything to share the learning journey.  
Later on, expand into **Python + InfoSec** as a separate track.

## 📦 Web Development Certifications (FCC)
### Current:
- [x] Responsive Web Design  
  - 🖥️ [FCC Projects – Responsive Web Design (CodePen Collection)](https://codepen.io/collection/OyNaGb)  
- [x] JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures  
  - 🖥️ [FCC Projects – JS: Algorithms & Data Structures (CodePen Collection)](https://codepen.io/collection/EPypbo )  
    
### Yet To Start:
- [ ] Front End Libraries  
  - _(collection link placeholder)_  
- [ ] Data Visualization  
  - _(collection link placeholder)_  
- [ ] Back End Development and APIs  
  - _(collection link placeholder)_  
- [ ] Relational Databases  
  - _(collection link placeholder)_  
- [ ] Quality Assurance  
  - _(collection link placeholder)_  

👉 After the modern **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures**, I’ll also complete the **Legacy JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** track to strengthen my fundamentals (my “K’nex level” of programming).

## 📚 Bonus Material

- **Project Euler** → Math-heavy problems (likely more relevant to the Python/InfoSec track).  
- **Rosetta Code** → Implementing algorithms & data structures in multiple languages.  
- **Coding Interview Prep** → Extra practice for problem-solving, pattern recognition, and technical interviews.  

These are treated as *sub-sections* to their relevant counterparts (JS, Python, or algorithms).

## 🛠 Other Learning Paths

- **The Odin Project** — Full web dev path; treated as its own track, complementing FCC.  
- **Python + InfoSec (later)** — To be pursued after the Web track, including deeper algorithmic work (Euler, Rosetta, security concepts).

This is not just about certifications — it’s about becoming a better thinker, builder, and problem-solver.
