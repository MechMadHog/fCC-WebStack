# 🌐 My freeCodeCamp Full Stack Development Path

Tracking my full progress through the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum — replacing social media with skill-building and working toward mastery in full-stack web development.

## 📅 Started: August 2025  
## 🔄 In Progress: Responsive Web Design  

---

## 🎯 Goal
Complete the **first seven Web-focused certifications**, build portfolio-ready projects, and document everything to share the learning journey.  
Later on, expand into **Python + InfoSec** as a separate track.

## 📦 Web Development Certifications (FCC)
### Completed:
- [x] Responsive Web Design  
  - 🖥️ [FCC Projects – Responsive Web Design (CodePen Collection)](https://codepen.io/collection/OyNaGb)
- [x] JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures  
  - 🖥️ [FCC Projects – JS: Algorithms & Data Structures (CodePen Collection)](https://codepen.io/collection/EPypbo)  
- [x] Front End Libraries
  - 🖥️ [FCC Projects - Front End Development Libraries (CodePen Collection)](https://codepen.io/collection/VvmzEd)
- [x] Data Visualization
  - 🖥️ [FCC Projects - Data Visualization (CodePen Collection)](https://codepen.io/collection/qBqJrq)

### Current:
- [ ] Back End Development and APIs  
- [ ] Information Security & Quality Assurance 

*Tricky - Lots of Debugging along the way (No where near as straight forward for fCC to connect to my code)*

### Yet To Start:
- [ ] Relational Databases  **BONUS**

## 📚 Bonus Material (These are treated as *sub-sections* to their relevant counterparts (JS, Python, or algorithms).  )

- **Project Euler** → Math-heavy problems (likely more relevant to the Python/InfoSec track).  
- **Rosetta Code** → Implementing algorithms & data structures in multiple languages.  
- **Coding Interview Prep** → Extra practice for problem-solving, pattern recognition, and technical interviews.

## 🛠 Ways to strengthen my JavaScript Skills:

- **The Odin Project** — Full web dev path; treated as its own track, complementing FCC.
