# Front End Development Libraries, Portfolio Projects

**FreeCodeCamp Certificate 03: Front End Development Libraries (In Progress)**  
[View Certificate](#)

🧠 This is my third FreeCodeCamp certificate.  
If the first proved I could **build** the house (HTML/CSS) and the second wired it with **logic** (JavaScript), this one is about lighting it up;bringing color, motion, and interactivity through libraries and frameworks.

Here I move from raw DOM scripting into the tools that power real front-end apps: **React**, **Redux**, **Bootstrap**, and **SASS**. Each project is about state, data-flow, and user experience... how components render, respond, and evolve.

Like before, I treat the base assignments as **scaffolds** / foundations to customize and expand into portfolio pieces that feel alive and expressive.

## 1. 🟡 Random Quote Machine → *Random (Simpsons) Quote Machine*
**Origin:** FCC Random Quote Machine  
**Project:** [Simpsons Quote Machine](https://codepen.io/Mike-MacDonagh/pen/KwVjwzy)  
**What I learned:**  
- Used React 17 to avoid known testing issues with React 18’s root API  
- Managed local state for quote and author, rendered dynamically  
- Built a Simpsons-themed UI using bright yellows, teal accents, and cartoon clouds  
- Added a local quotes array for reliability instead of unstable APIs  
- Styled with just CSS to capture the show’s flat-toon look while keeping all FCC test IDs intact

## 2. 📝 Markdown Previewer
**Origin:** FCC Markdown Previewer  
**Project:** *Coming soon*  
**Plan:** Use React’s controlled components to render live Markdown input via the `marked` library, styled with a CRT-terminal aesthetic. Include themes toggled by state (dark / light / blueprint).

## 3. 🥁 Drum Machine
**Origin:** FCC Drum Machine  
**Project:** *Planned*  
**Plan:** A synthwave-inspired pad grid using keyboard bindings, Web Audio API for custom sounds, and neon reactive animations tied to Redux actions.

## 4. 🧮 JavaScript Calculator
**Origin:** FCC JavaScript Calculator  
**Project:** *Planned*  
**Plan:** Minimalist, glassy calculator built in React with dynamic expression parsing, chained operations, and smooth button feedback — themeable via SASS variables.

## 5. ⏱️ "Pomodoro" Clock
**Origin:** FCC 25 + 5 Clock 
**Project:** *Planned*  
**Plan:** A clean timer interface with animated circular progress, pause/resume control via Redux state, and a focus-mode design echoing mechanical stopwatch dials.

## 🎓 Conclusion
This certificate is where logic gets restructured. 
By the end of it, I’ll have built five complete React apps that not only pass FCC’s tests but stand alone as cohesive, themed experiences;each showing how I can use libraries as creative instruments, not crutches.
